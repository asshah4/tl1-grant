Assignment Objectives
=====================

This analysis exercise is to use sample data (from the research study of
the work of this author) to create a bivariate analysis and present this
in the creation of tables.

The assignment objectives are as follows:

1.  Select one variable to be the primary exposure of interest. Select
    one variable to be the primary outcome of interest.

2.  Create a Table 1, which presents the distribution of the primary
    exposure variable by other participant characteristics in the
    dataset.

-   For Table 1, the exposure variable should be a dichotomous variable
    (or transformed into a dichotomous variable).

-   Table 1 should have five columns (participant characteristics,
    exposed, not exposed, total, p-value); the exposure variable being
    in the columns and the participant characteristics in the rows.

-   There must be at least 5 participant characteristics (rows) in Table
    1 including a minimum of 1 continuous variable. The primary outcome
    variable should also be one of the participant characteristics
    included as a row.

3.  Create a Table 2, which presents the distribution of the primary
    outcome variable by other participant characteristics in the
    dataset.

-   For Table 2, the outcome variable should be a dichotomous variable
    (or transformed into a dichotomous variable).

-   Table 2 should have five columns; the outcome variable being in the
    columns and the participant characteristics in the rows.

-   There must be at least 5 participant characteristics in Table 2
    including a minimum of 1 continuous variable and the participant
    characteristics in Table 1. The primary exposure variable should
    also be one of the participant characteristics included as a row.

4.  Answer questions on page 3 of this instruction document which relate
    to the tables and interpretation of the data. Be sure to read these
    questions prior to creating the tables. Answers should be typed.

*Table 2.. We compared patients with normal and abnormal myocardial
perfusion. We compared stress test result groups to demographic and
clinical covariates, as well as the exposure variable of normal versus
abnormal DYX. FRS = Framingham risk score, PTSD = post-traumatic stress
disorder, BMI = body mass index. Continuous normal variables were tested
using t-test, and chi-square test (Fisher test when frequency \< 5) for
categorical variables.*

Table Questions {#table-questions-1}
===============

Question 1. Titles
------------------

Each table should have a descriptive title. List the titles for your
Table 1 and Table 2 here:

**1A. Table 1 title:**

*Description of patient characteristics by low and normal HRV*

**1B. Table 2 title:**

*Between-group differences of patient characteristics by abnormal
myocardial perfusion imaging*

Question 2. Exposure table
--------------------------

**2A. What was the primary exposure variable chosen for Table 1?**

Low versus normal heart rate variability (HRV), measured by the
non-linear HRV measure Dyx at the cutpoint of 2.0

**2B. How many participants were in each of the two exposure
categories?**

Low = 216 Normal = 38

**2C. How were participants who had missing values of the primary
exposure handled?**

The exposure was generated through ECG analysis mulitple steps prior.
They were excluded from the sample population based on missing-values at
initial data preparation. For this subset of hte study, we used a single
hour of 24-hours of data to calculate measures. Durng this 1 hour, out
of the 262 patients, 8 patients had missing HRV data. This group was
excluded in the tables, leading to a total of 254. Roughly 3% data loss.
They were kept in the larger data pool because other hours they were
able to contribute, and in more complex analyses we used imputation to
help generate values (time series analysis prior to HRV calculation from
ECG data).

Question 3. Outcome table
-------------------------

**3A. What was the primary outcome variable chosen for Table 2?**

Abnormal versus normal stress test, determined by myocardial perfusion
imaging using adenosine stress.

**3B. How many participants were in each of the two outcome
categories?**

Normal stress = 204 Abnormal stress = 50

**3C. How were participants who had missing values of the primary
outcome handled?**

The patients that were unable to tolerate stress tests were excluded
from the study initially. The purpose of the study was obtaining stress
tests, thus that data was excluded from the study onset. In terms of HRV
values, as above, the same population of 8 individuals were excluded for
missingness during 1 hour of the 24 hour sample.

Question 4. Continuous variable statistical testing
---------------------------------------------------

**4A. State a participant characteristic that was included as a
continuous variable in Table 1.**

Age was a simple continous variable used in Table 1.

**4B. What statistical test was used to compare this continuous variable
across exposure categories? Justify your decision to use this
statistical test.**

We used a two-sample t-test because, although based on size alone we can
suppose we have a normal distribution, the SD of population is not
known, thus the sample SD has to be used. Thus, t-test.

**4C. What was the null hypothesis of the statistical test used?**

H0 = Mean age of those with normal stress tests is the same as that of
those with abnormal stress tests.

**4D. Provide a correct interpretation of the p-value in one sentence.**

P-value of 0.667, with an alpha of 0.05, suggests that there is
insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Question 5. Categorical variable statistical testing
----------------------------------------------------

**5A. State a participant characteristic that was included as a
categorical variable in Table 2.**

PTSD was selected as a categorical variable in this study (presence or
absence by clinical chart review).

**5B. What statistical test was used to compare this categorical
variable across outcome categories? Justify your decision to use this
statistical test.**

Because this was a categorical variable, the chi-squared test of
independence was used. This test was appropriate since it looks for
whether or not there is a significant difference between teh expected
and observed frequences in multiple categories. Essentially, its testing
if there is independence among the groups.

**5C. What was the null hypothesis of the statistical test used?**

H0 = There is not a diffence in the frequency of PTSD in patients with
normal stress and in the frequency of PTSD in those with abnormal
stress. (Could also say proportion instead of frequency)

**5D. Provide a correct interpretation of the p-value in one sentence.**

The p-value = 0.436, with alpha = 0.05, suggesting that there is not
sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis such that the
proportions between populations are similar (not independent).

Question 6. Interpretation of findings
--------------------------------------

**6A. Using one sentence, describe the association between the primary
exposure and primary outcome variables chosen. Report a measure of
association and 95% confidence interval for the association.**

When considering the exposure as a continuous variable, abnormal/low Dyx
(HRV measure) is associated with abnormal stress, via two-sample t-test
(t = 2, df = 74, p = 0.04).

DYX is higher in patients with normal stress (0.395) than in abnormal
stress (0.0392), such that there is a difference between the means of
the populations based on a two-sample t-test (95% CI 0.0191 - 0.6935, t
= 2, DF = 74, p = 0.04).

If considering off of an artificial cutpoint, as per Table 1, then there
is no association between the exposure of low DYX and abnormal stress
test by chi-square test of independence (X\^2 = 0.798, p = 0.372), and a
confidence interval can be generated with 2-sample test of proportions
with continuity correction (95% confidence interval -0.0868 to 0.2427).

**6B. Which, if any, of the participant characteristics are likely
confounding the relation between the primary exposure and outcome
variables? Using one or two sentences, justify the answer with
information generated in Table 1 and Table 2.**

Not enough is known about autonomic dysfunction to allow us to assess
for confounding. PTSD and depression effect teh ANS centrally, while HTN
and age effect ANS systemically, and integration at the level of the
heart leads to the HRV measure. Depression would likely be the strongest
candidate to be a confounder, if anything. However, based on teh DAG
model, there would not be an unblocked open path from HRV to abnormal
stress test.
