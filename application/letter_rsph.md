Dear Review Committee,

Thank you so much for considering Anish's application for the TL1
program. He has exceptional promise as a researcher, based on our work
together thus far. We are writing this letter to clarify certain aspects
of his appointment.

Starting July 1, 2019, Dr. Shah will hire him as a post-doctoral fellow
within the Department of Epidemiology, and have project-based funding to
support him. He will have no clinical responsibilities during this time.
Dr. Shah's funding can support him for 2 years, which is our intention
for his time with us. If funded by the TL1, he will have support to
focus on additional training with the MSCR, and also have the autonomy
to specifically study the neurocardiac axis as it relates to coronary
artery disease (as per his application). The MSCR will go a long way in
enabling Anish to be an independent clinical investigator in cardiology,
which is his long term goal. Anish has demonstrated an extremely strong
work ethic and productivity to support these goals.

Thank you again for considering Anish for your program, and we are happy
to address any additional questions or concerns you may have.

Best regards,
