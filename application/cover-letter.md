Dear Selection Committee,

Please accept this letter to signify my interest in the TL1 award,
including the Master of Science in Clinical Research.

I am citizen of the United States and am not a recipient of any other
NIH awards. I am a resident in internal medicine with the goal to
one-day become an independently funded clinical investigator. I believe
that mentored training and formal didactics gained through this proposal
will be critical for my career growth. My proposal, entitled
"Disturbances of the Neurocardiac Axis: Using Heart Rate Variability to
Measure Disease in the Brain and Heart", outlines my approach and skills
and competencies I will gain in this upcoming year.

I hope you will consider my application for the TL1 award.

Sincerely,

Anish Shah, MD
