Dear Selection Committee,

Please accept this letter of intent to clarify my goals as they relate
to my TL1 application, "Disturbances of the Neurocardiac Axis: Using
Heart Rate Variability to Measure Disease in the Brain and Heart."

I am currently in my third (final) year of internal medicine residency,
with clinical obligations concluding upon June 30^th^, 2019. On July
1^st^, 2019, I will continue as a post-doctoral fellow in the Rollins
School of Public Health in the Department of Epidemiology. I have a
strong interest in clinical research, and am taking this upcoming year
to dedicate towards my research training. I intend to stay employed as a
postdoctoral fellow for 2 years, which will help me to complete the
MSCR, finish my research project with at least 2 first-author papers
submitted for peer review, and apply for an F32 or similar award.

Please reach out at any time to myself or my mentors and supervisors for
further questions.

Sincerely,

Anish Shah, MD
